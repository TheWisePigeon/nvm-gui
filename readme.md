# NVM-GUI

This little app is for "lazy" developers, especially those using Windows, that don't want to open a terminal in admin mode everytime they want to switch from a nodejs version to another.

It's built on top of [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) using :

- Tauri
- Rust
- TypeScript

## Features

Being able to switch between nodejs versions is the main feature of this app. 

Installing and uninstalling nodejs versions will also be supported in a near future.
